# Sales_forecasting - Udacity Capstone Project
This repository, part of Udacity "Machine Learning Engineer" Nanodegree program contains my "Capstone Project".
I choose to work on sales forecasting, with the Walmart dataset available on Kaggle with this link :
https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting
The dataset provide historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions. 
Each store contains many departments, and participants must project the sales for each department in each store.
